# Project
Bank Fund Management System.

* Using oops concept, I created a sample project on bank fund management.
* Implemented multilevel Inheritance to create linkage between all the classes.
* Using file handling to store and retrieve the data.
* In each branch class ensures that an account can only be closed if its balance is zero. If the balance is greater than zero, the method prompts the user to withdraw the amount first before closing the account.
* Each branch class has methods for account operations like opening, depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and closing an account.
